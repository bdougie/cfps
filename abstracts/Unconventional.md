Having a clear understanding of the key metrics to measure and optimize is essential for project success, but itâ€™s not always obvious what to track. This talk will explore the lesser-discussed metrics that all open-source projects should be tracking how often contributors return, and even the ratio of employee to community contributions in the most popular projects on GitHub. We'll also delve into contributor metrics such as spam rates, pull request velocity and SLAs.

With this tour into insights into the less apparent metrics that matter, open-source project maintainers will be better equipped to work smarter toward success (whatever that means to them) and make data-informed decisions about the future of their projects.

Most projects measure success based on stars, but instead, they would benefit from turning stars into first-time contributors. This talk will walk through how a project's success can be correlated to second-time contributors.
