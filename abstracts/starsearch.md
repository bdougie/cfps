title: StarSearch, Copilot for Git History

abstract:

Staying up to date on notable developments and key contributors can be challenging, especially when product owners and engineering leaders move to new roles. Their departure often leads to the loss of valuable historical knowledge about the codebase.

To address this issue, we have developed a novel approach that leverages GitHub event data and LLMs. Our solution, called StarSearch, acts as a "Copilot for Git History," allowing stakeholders to query the codebase not only for code-related information. Join me in learning how you can make historical knowledge accessible using StarSearch.

outline:

Introduction: In this talk, we'll introduce StarSearch, a groundbreaking tool that helps you discover hidden gems within your codebase using Large Language Models (LLMs). Just as the 90's TV show "Star Search" uncovered talented performers like Beyonc√©, StarSearch enables you to identify the star contributors and valuable insights buried in your code history.
Relevance to Track: As AI continues to dominate the conversation, there is a growing need for real-world, production-ready use cases. Our solution leverages open-source data and technologies to validate the effectiveness and practicality of StarSearch, making it a highly relevant topic for this track.
Interactive Elements: To engage the audience, we will provide access to a live demonstration site during the talk. Attendees will have the opportunity to explore StarSearch's capabilities firsthand and witness its potential in action.
Visual Aids: The presentation will feature a mix of recorded interactions and live demonstrations, ensuring a dynamic and accessible experience for all attendees. Additionally, we will provide supplementary materials, such as diagrams, flowcharts, and walkthroughs, via a dedicated GitHub repository for easy reference and further exploration.
Case Studies and Examples: We have gathered compelling examples and success stories from our users, primarily from the open-source maintainer community. Notable users include Evan You (Vue), Taylor Otwell (Laravel), and Supabase, who have all leveraged StarSearch to gain valuable insights into their codebases. We will also share a recent case study involving the Tailwind team, who utilized StarSearch to identify Rust experts within their community.
Conclusion: By the end of this talk, the audience will have gained a fresh perspective on how to harness the power of open-source data and public LLMs. They will leave with a deeper understanding of StarSearch's potential to revolutionize the way we explore and understand our codebases, empowering developers and maintainers to make more informed decisions and drive innovation.
