Solve Good First Issues With AI
Good first isssues don't exist

## Abstract

From my time at GitHub, I learned that the label "good first issue" was created in response to the popularity of the first-timers-only project. The good first issue adds a label to identify bugs and minor fixes for anyone looking for a safe space to try their hand at an approachable contribution.

I built a chrome extension for GitHub to use any repo's context to leverage AI and generate code suggestions for any good first issue. But a  good first issue should include a solution for any new contributor to a project. Join me in learning how this works.
