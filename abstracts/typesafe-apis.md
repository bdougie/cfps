# Building Typesafe APIs with tRPC & TypeScript

**Abstract**:

When developing modern APIs, there a few options to choose from. REST is not a standard  but instead style. Trust is constantly broken between the API and client. gRPC and GraphQL provide standards but require complex tooling.

Achieving a consistency in data, as well as a great developer experience seemed impossible until now. tRPC exist to provide type safety end to end, ensuring the contract for the API boundary can be trusted by default. Join me in learning how to build typesafe APIs with tRPC and TypeScript and staying cutting edge with the tooling to do it.
