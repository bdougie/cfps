## abstract

Finding success in open source can be challenging. Having a clear understanding of the key metrics to measure and optimize is essential for project success, but itâ€™s not always obvious what to track. This talk will explore the lesser-discussed metrics that all open-source projects should be tracking, including both contributor metrics and end-user usage metrics. We'll delve into contributor metrics such as spam rates, pull request velocity and SLAs, and repeat contributors, as well as end-user metrics like documentation to download ratios, churn rates, unique users, and end-user geography. With this guide to the less obvious metrics that matter, open-source project maintainers will be better equipped to work smarter toward success (whatever that means to them) and make data-informed decisions about the future of their projects.
