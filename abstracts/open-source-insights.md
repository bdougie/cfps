# Open Source Insights

## Abstract
There is a need to leverage open-source to stay competitive, and the benefit of open source is the ability for developers to contribute and work where they are. There is also a need for open-source sustainability with contributions but approaching even familiar projects can be daunting for contributors.

Each handles encouraging contributions differently and even some prefer no contribution. Join me in learning the ways maintainers can leverage data and automation to encourage folks to contribute with code and non-code contributions, without removing them selves from the day to day code.

Topics covered:
- GitHub Actions for automation
- GitHub insights for knowing what to automate
