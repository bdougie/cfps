In this talk, I will walk through how you can leverage this tool for creating action-packed workflows that on GitHub by building your containers to run arbitrary code or even automate welcoming new users to your projects.

notes: 
I am an employee at GitHub and enjoy creating examples and content about how people can leverage GitHub in new ways. The focus on this talk will include GitHub as a baseline but focus on how the Ruby SDK can be leveraged as well as the code that builds it.
