# Path to your next contribution

short:

Join me in this talk on how I leveraged my new and existing tools to find open source contributions that will grow your career as a developer. 

abstract:

Today Open Source is ubiquitous and comprises nearly 80% – 90% of the code in a “typical” application. Based on GitHub’s 2019 Octoverse, the average project is built on ~180 open source packages of dependencies.

There is a need to leverage open-source to stay competitive, and the benefit of open source is the ability for developers to contribute and work where they are. There is also a need for open-source sustainability with contributions technically and financially.
